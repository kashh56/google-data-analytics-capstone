# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project 🚀

## Project Title: Providing Data-Driven Suggestions for HR 💼

### Overview
This capstone project focuses on analyzing a dataset to build predictive models that provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of Salifort Motors. The aim is to predict employee turnover and identify factors contributing to employee attrition, enabling the HR department to enhance employee satisfaction and retention.

### Problem Statement
The HR department at Salifort Motors has collected data from employees but is unsure how to utilize it effectively. They seek data-driven suggestions to answer the critical question: **What factors are likely to make employees leave the company?** 🤔

### Goals 🎯
1. Analyze the HR dataset to understand employee satisfaction and turnover.
2. Build a predictive model to forecast whether an employee is likely to leave the company.
3. Provide actionable insights to enhance employee retention.

### Dataset Description 📊
The dataset contains **14,999 rows** and **10 columns**, with the following variables:

| Variable                  | Description                                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| satisfaction_level        | Employee-reported job satisfaction level [0–1]          |
| last_evaluation           | Score of employee's last performance review [0–1]       |
| number_project            | Number of projects the employee contributes to           |
| average_monthly_hours     | Average number of hours worked per month                 |
| time_spend_company       | How long the employee has been with the company (years) |
| Work_accident             | Whether or not the employee experienced a work accident  |
| left                      | Whether or not the employee left the company             |
| promotion_last_5years     | Whether or not the employee was promoted in the last 5 years |
| Department                | The employee's department                                 |
| salary                    | The employee's salary (U.S. dollars)                     |

### PACE Stages 📅
**Plan Stage:**

- **Stakeholders:** HR department, management team, employees.
- **Objectives:** Understand employee turnover, identify contributing factors, enhance retention strategies.
- **Initial Observations:** 
  - High turnover rates may correlate with low satisfaction levels. 📉
  - Performance evaluations and promotion history could impact retention. 📈
- **Resources:** 
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) for data analytics.
  - [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for data manipulation.
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for building predictive models.
- **Ethical Considerations:** 
  - Ensure data privacy and confidentiality. 🔒
  - Avoid bias in predictive modeling to prevent discrimination. ⚖️

### Deliverables 📑
1. **Summary Report:** A concise one-page summary outlining findings, insights, and recommendations for the HR department.
2. **Code Notebook:** A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook detailing the analysis process, model evaluation, and visualizations.

### Conclusion
Through this project, I aim to provide the HR department at Salifort Motors with valuable insights derived from data analysis. By predicting employee turnover, the company can implement strategies to improve satisfaction and retention, ultimately reducing costs associated with hiring and training new employees. 💪
